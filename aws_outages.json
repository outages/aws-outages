We have narrowed down the root cause to a specific sub-system within S3 and continue to make progress in mitigating the impact to this service but have not yet seen significant improvement. S3 API error rates and latencies have stayed a consistent low level with the vast majority of request retries succeeding. While the vast majority of requests are being processed within the normal latency levels, request tail latencies are exceeding 1 second in some cases. In some applications, increasing client timeouts may also help to mitigate the issue. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 4:52 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We are starting to see some improvement in the 5xx error rates and latencies for S3 API requests, in particular S3 PUT API calls. The issue affected a subsystem that stores routing metadata used by Amazon S3 to map API requests to the storage nodes. A recent update caused increased load within this subsystem, which led to increased error rates and latencies for the S3 APIs. We have now successfully mitigated this increased load within this subsystem and are seeing early signs of recovery. As the sub-system processes the backlog of requests, S3 API error rates and latencies will continue to improve.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 5:53 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We continue to see a gradual improvement in error rates as we process the backlog of mappings between request metadata and data storage in the sub-system affected by the increased load. We are currently working on mitigations to speed up the processing of the backlog during this event. Once the backlog is resolved, we expect that the error rate will fully recover. The vast majority of requests to S3 APIs continue to operate normally. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 6:58 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We continue to process the backlog of mappings between request metadata and data storage in the sub-system affected by the increased load.

Customers experiencing connectivity or instance availability issues within the affected Availability Zone, should start to see some recovery as power is restored to the affected data center. RunInstances API error rates are returning to normal levels and we are working to recover affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes. While we would expect continued improvement over the coming hour, we would still recommend failing away from the Availability Zone if you are able to do so to mitigate this issue.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 5:39 AM PST</span>&nbsp;We have now restored power to all instances and network devices within the affected data center and are seeing recovery for the majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes within the affected Availability Zone. Network connectivity within the affected Availability Zone has also returned to normal levels. While all services are starting to see meaningful recovery, services which were hosting endpoints within the affected data center - such as single-AZ RDS databases, ElastiCache, etc. - would have seen impact during the event, but are starting to see recovery now. Given the level of recovery, if you have not yet failed away from the affected Availability Zone, you should be starting to see recovery at this stage. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 6:13 AM PST</span>&nbsp;We have now restored power to all instances and network devices within the affected data center and are seeing recovery for the majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes within the affected Availability Zone.

We have a small number of affected EBS volumes that are still experiencing degraded IO performance that we are working to recover. The majority of AWS services have also recovered, but services which host endpoints within the customer’s VPCs - such as single-AZ RDS databases, ElasticCache, Redshift, etc. - continue to see some impact as we work towards full recovery. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 6:51 AM PST</span>&nbsp;We have now restored power to all instances and network devices within the affected data center and are seeing recovery for the majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes within the affected Availability Zone. For the remaining EC2 instances, we are experiencing some network connectivity issues, which is slowing down full recovery. We believe we understand why this is the case and are working on a resolution. Once resolved, we expect to see faster recovery for the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes. If you are able to relaunch affected EC2 instances within the affected Availability Zone, that may help to speed up recovery. Note that restarting an instance at this stage will not help as a restart does not change the underlying hardware. We have a small number of affected EBS volumes that are still experiencing degraded IO performance that we are working to recover.

We have been working to resolve the connectivity issues that the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes are experiencing in the affected data center, which is part of a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region. We have addressed the connectivity issue for the affected EBS volumes, which are now starting to see further recovery. We continue to work on mitigating the networking impact for EC2 instances within the affected data center, and expect to see further recovery there starting in the next 30 minutes. Since the EC2 APIs have been healthy for some time within the affected Availability Zone, the fastest path to recovery now would be to relaunch affected EC2 instances within the affected Availability Zone or other Availability Zones within the region.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 9:28 AM PST</span>&nbsp;We continue to make progress in restoring connectivity to the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes. In the last hour, we have restored underlying connectivity to the majority of the remaining EC2 instance and EBS volumes, but are now working through full recovery at the host level. The majority of affected AWS services remain in recovery and we have seen recovery for the majority of single-AZ RDS databases that were affected by the event. If you are able to relaunch affected EC2 instances within the affected Availability Zone, that may help to speed up recovery. Note that restarting an instance at this stage will not help as a restart does not change the underlying hardware.

We believe this is related to the way in which the data center lost power, which has led to failures in the underlying hardware that we are working to recover. While EC2 instances and EBS volumes that have recovered continue to operate normally within the affected data center, we are working to replace hardware components for the recovery of the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes. We have multiple engineers working on the underlying hardware failures and expect to see recovery over the next few hours. As is often the case with a loss of power, there may be some hardware that is not recoverable, and so we continue to recommend that you relaunch your EC2 instance, or recreate you EBS volume from a snapshot, if you are able to do so.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">12:03 PM PST</span>&nbsp;Over the last hour, after addressing many of the underlying hardware failures, we have seen an accelerated rate of recovery for the affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes. We continue to work on addressing the underlying hardware failures that are preventing the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes. For customers that continue to have EC2 instance or EBS volume impairments, relaunching affected EC2 instances or recreating affecting EBS volumes within the affected Availability Zone, continues to be a faster path to full recovery. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 1:39 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We continue to make progress in addressing the hardware failures that are delaying recovery of the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes. At this stage, if you are still waiting for an EC2 instance or EBS volume to fully recover, we would strongly recommend that you consider relaunching the EC2 instance or recreating the EBS volume from a snapshot. As is often the case with a loss of power, there may be some hardware that is not recoverable, which will prevent us from fully recovering the affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes. We are not quite at that point yet in terms of recovery, but it is unlikely that we will recover all of the small number of remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes. If you need help in launching new EC2 instances or recreating EBS volumes, please reach out to AWS Support.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 3:13 PM PST</span>&nbsp;Since the last update, we have more than halved the number of affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes and continue to work on the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes. The remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes have all experienced underlying hardware failures due to the nature of the initial power event, which we are working to resolve. We expect to make further progress on this list within the next hour, but some of the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes may not be recoverable due to hardware failures. If you have the ability to relaunch an affected EC2 instance or recreate an affected EBS volume from snapshot, we continue to strongly recommend that you take that path.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 4:22 PM PST</span>&nbsp;Starting at 4:11 AM PST some EC2 instances and EBS volumes experienced a loss of power in a single data center within a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region. Instances in other data centers within the affected Availability Zone, and other Availability Zones within the US-EAST-1 Region were not affected by this event. At 4:55 AM PST, power was restored to EC2 instances and EBS volumes in the affected data center, which allowed the majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes to recover. However, due to the nature of the power event, some of the underlying hardware experienced failures, which needed to be resolved by engineers within the facility. Engineers worked to recover the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes affected by the issue. By 2:30 PM PST, we recovered the vast majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes. However, some of the affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes were running on hardware that has been affected by the loss of power and is not recoverable. For customers still waiting for recovery of a specific EC2 instance or EBS volume, we recommend that you relaunch the instance or recreate the volume from a snapshot for full recovery.

For customers that are able to fail away from the affected Availability Zone, we recommend doing so.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">11:55 AM PDT</span>&nbsp;We continue to investigate instance impairments to a single Availability Zone in the EU-WEST-2 Region. We have experienced an increase in temperatures within a single data center in the affected Availability Zone, which in some cases has caused impairments for instances in the Availability Zone. We have engineers within the affected data center and are working to resolve the issue. ELB has shifted traffic away from the affected Availability Zone, and API Gateway has mitigated the majority of impact and continues to work on the remaining endpoints. Elastic File System (EFS) is experiencing errors within the affected Availability Zone. RedShift, OpenSearch, and ElastiCache are experiencing error rates for clusters within the affected Availability Zone. RDS has successfully mitigated impact for all multi-AZ databases, however single-AZ databases will remain affected until we see recovery. Lambda is largely unaffected by the event, however a very small number of functions may be experiencing invocation errors within the affected Availability Zone. The EC2 APIs are experiencing increased error rates within the affected Availability Zone, but instance launches continue to work on other Availability Zones. Some services, like EMR and Fargate, are seeing delays in provisioning new instances in the affected Availability Zone due to the EC2 API impact in that Availability Zone. Our engineering teams continue to work towards identifying the root cause of the thermal event and resolving it. At this stage, we do not have an ETA but still expect it to be more than an hour. We continue to recommend using other Availability Zones in the EU-WEST-2 Region, which remain unaffected by this event.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">12:25 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We have resolved the root cause of the thermal event and are starting to see recovery for impaired EC2 instances within the EU-WEST-2 Region. At this stage, the vast majority of EC2 instances have recovered and we continue to work on the instances that are still affected. ELB and API Gateway have shifted traffic away from the affected Availability Zone. EFS is only experiencing error rates for one zone filesystems within the affected Availability Zone; standard filesystems, which use multiple Availability Zones, are not affected. Customers should now be seeing recovery for instance impairments, and we expect to see recovery for the vast majority of instances within the next hour. We will continue to provide updates as recovery continues.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 1:01 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We continue to make progress in resolving the EC2 impaired instances in a single Availability Zone in the EU-WEST-2 Region. At this stage, the vast majority of affected instances have recovered and we continue to work towards full recovery. ELB and API Gateway remain weighted away from the affected Availability Zone for now. EFS has recovered the availability of all One Zone file systems in the affected Availability Zone. RDS multi-AZ databases remain available and we are starting to see recovery for single-AZ databases within the affected Availability Zone. EKS pods within the affected Availability Zone are starting to see recovery, however EKS did experience failures during cluster creation during the event. RedShift, OpenSearch, and ElastiCache are starting to see recovery within the affected Availability Zone. EC2 APIs have fully recovered and new instances can once again be launched in the affected Availability Zone. Customers should be seeing most of their affected instances in recovery, although we continue to work on a small number of affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes that are still impaired. We will continue to provide updates as recovery progresses.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 1:53 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;We have resolved the impairments for the vast majority of EC2 instances in the affected Availability Zone (euw2-az1) in the EU-WEST-2 Region. There are a small number of EC2 instances and EBS volumes that were hosted on hardware that have been affected by the loss of power during the thermal event. For these EC2 instances and EBS volumes, we will be opening Personal Health Dashboard notices to track recovery. We have seen full recovery for a number of AWS services, including AWS Transit Gateway, Amazon Connect, Amazon Relational Database Service, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic File System, Amazon, Elastic Kubernetes Service, Amazon Elastic MapReduce, Amazon OpenSearch Service, and Amazon Redshift. The remaining AWS services, including Amazon API Gateway, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Elastic Load Balancing are very close to full recovery at this stage. Elastic Load Balancing and API Gateway will be shifting traffic back into the affected Availability Zone shortly. We’re working through the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes and expect to see full recovery in the next 30 minutes.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\"> 2:07 PM PDT</span>&nbsp;Starting at 10:25 AM PDT, some EC2 instances and EBS volumes were impaired in a single Availability Zone (euw2-az1) in the EU-WEST-2 Region. The issue was caused by a thermal event, which caused some of instances to lose power and some EBS volumes to experience degraded IO performance. Recovery started at 12:01 PM PDT and by 12:12 PM PDT, the vast majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes had fully recovered. Other AWS services also experienced impact during the event, including API Gateway, Elastic Load Balancing, Database Migration Service, Transit Gateway, CloudFront, Connect, ElastiCache, Elastic Container Service, Elastic File System, Elastic Kubernetes Service, Elastic MapReduce, OpenSearch, Redshift, and Relational Database Service. These services are all now operating normally.
